# Nigel - SolidWorks® Assembly

## Notes

- The [detailed SolidWorks® Assembly of Nigel](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/tree/AutoDRIVE-Testbed/Vehicle/Mechanical/Designing/SolidWorks) was modified/simplified to have a single part of [`Chassis.SLDPRT`](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/blob/AutoDRIVE-Testbed/Vehicle/Mechanical/Designing/Simscape/SolidWorks%20Assembly/Chassis.SLDPRT) and sub-assemblies for `Drive Mechanism` & `Steering Mechanism`, which is available as [`Nigel.SLDASM`](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/blob/AutoDRIVE-Testbed/Vehicle/Mechanical/Designing/Simscape/SolidWorks%20Assembly/Nigel.SLDASM) within this repository.
- The STEP (model) files, XML (schema) file, TXT (error) file exported by [Simscape™ Multibody™ Link plugin for SolidWorks®](https://www.mathworks.com/help/smlink/ug/installing-and-linking-simmechanics-link-software.html), MATLAB® script, and Simulink® model of Nigel are compressed (to reduce file size) and available as [`Simscape Multibody.zip`](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/blob/AutoDRIVE-Testbed/Vehicle/Mechanical/Designing/Simscape/Simscape%20Multibody/Simscape%20Multibody.zip) within this repository.
